# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- Added centralized image MIME, image-size, PowerShell, and error utilities used by clipboard, preview, attachment, and recent-image flows.
- Added size-limit enforcement for image attachments, recent-cache writes, recent-image loads, and Sixel preview conversion through `PI_IMAGE_TOOLS_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`.

### Changed
- Reworked recent-image caching to use an extension-owned cache directory with safe pruning that preserves user files.
- Reworked Sixel preview rendering to use an existing PowerShell `Sixel` module only, normalize converter output into complete terminal sequences, and fall back to native previews with actionable warnings.
- Reworked terminal image width resolution to honor Pi project/global `terminal.imageWidthCells` settings with a documented default fallback.

### Fixed
- Prevented extension debug logging from writing terminal output; debug events now remain file-based and disabled by default.
- Preserved Sixel, Kitty, and iTerm inline image protocol rows during preview width fitting.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-04-25

### Changed
- Avoid Pi's built-in image paste shortcut by default while preserving the previous primary shortcut when users disable or rebind `app.clipboard.pasteImage` (thanks to @danielcherubini for reporting this in PR #3).
- Replaced the placeholder `enabled` config with validated `debug`, explicit `shortcuts.pasteImage`, configurable built-in conflict avoidance, and built-in warning suppression settings.
- Removed obsolete packaged README image assets now that the README uses a GitHub-hosted image.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- Updated README image to use HTML tag for better npm display compatibility
- Added npm keywords for improved package discoverability
- Added Related Pi Extensions cross-linking section to README

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- Added Linux clipboard image support via `wl-paste` and `xclip` fallback readers.
- Added Linux and macOS default recent-image discovery locations so the recent picker works beyond Windows.
- Added non-Windows image paste shortcuts including `Ctrl+V` in addition to the existing alternate bindings.

### Changed
- Updated README documentation to reflect current cross-platform support, clipboard backends, recent-image discovery behavior, and inline preview details.

### Fixed
- Removed the Windows-only extension gate so supported non-Windows platforms can register commands and shortcuts.
- Preserved Kitty and iTerm inline image protocol rows during preview width fitting, alongside the existing Sixel-safe handling.
- Improved clipboard reader error handling so unsupported environments report missing backends more clearly.
